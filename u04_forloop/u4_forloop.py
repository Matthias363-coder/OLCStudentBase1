# for loop print numbers from 0 - 9
 ### range will start from 0, up to this number (not including)
# for i in range(73):
#     print(i)

# 1 - 10
# range() has 3 options
# range(stop) >>>> range(10): 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9

# range(start, stop) >>>> range(1, 11): 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
# print numbers from 34 - 46
# for i in range(34, 47): # 34-47
#     print(i)

# range(start, stop , step) # print multiples of X
# for i in range(2, 25, 2):
#     print(i)

# print multiples of 7, 7 to 84
# for i in range(7, 91, 7):
#     print(i)
# using a for loop, 
# range(), 3 options

# string
# name = "MATTHIAS"
# for c in name:
#     print(c)

# list

# dictionary

# 2 types of loops - for loop and while loop
# for - loops where it is a finite, you know exactly how many times to repeat

# while - you do not know how many times to repeat



# Exercise 11: Custom Counting Pattern
# Write a program to print the following pattern:
# 5
# 44
# 333
# 2222
# 11111

# for loop, use multiply
# *
# **
# ***
# ****
# *****

# print("*" * 1)
# print("*" * 2)
# print("*" * 3)
# print("*" * 4)
# print("*" * 5)

# for i in range(1,6):
#     print("*" * i)

# word = "SINGAPORE"

# # loop through every single letter in this word
# for c in word:
#     print(c)

# write a cheer program

# ask for a name

# for loop through every single character
# name = input("Who to cheer! ")
# for c in name:
#     print(c)

# print("Who is the best?!?!?")
# print(name)

# Exercise 12: Generating a Multiplication Table
# Write a program to print the multiplication table of 6.
# Example: 6 x 1 = 6, ..., 6 x 10 = 60.

# ask for a number #7

# expected output up to 12 times
# 7 x 0 = 0
# 7 x 1 = 7
# 7 x 2 = 14
# 7 x 3 = 21
# 7 x 4 = 28
# ....
#num = int(input("Give me a number ")) #8 

# print(f"{num} x {1} = {num * 1}")
# print(f"{num} x {2} = {num * 2}")
# print(f"{num} x {3} = {num * 3}")
# print(f"{num} x {4} = {num * 4}")

# print numbers from 0 - 9

# print numbers from 1 to 15

# print even numbers from 2 to 24
